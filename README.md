# Real Estate Data Scraping and House Price Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze real estate market trends by first scraping property data and then performing detailed price analysis. The scraped data includes various attributes such as property type, size, year built, number of bedrooms, and price. After collecting the data, we conduct a thorough analysis to uncover insights into pricing trends and factors influencing house prices.

### Project Structure:
1. **Data Scraping**: Collect real estate listings from online sources to build a dataset that includes properties' details such as location, size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and prices.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, correct data formats, and ensure consistency in the dataset.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform statistical analysis and visualizations to identify trends, correlations, and patterns in the data.

### Features:
- Scraping real estate listings.
- Collecting and cleaning data on property attributes.
- Exploring data through visualizations.
- Key insights into factors that affect house prices.

### Technologies Used:
- Python (BeautifulSoup, Selenium for scraping)
- Pandas, NumPy for data cleaning and manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualizations
- Jupyter notebooks for analysis

### Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### How to Use
1. Run the scraping script to gather data:
   ```bash
   python realStateScrapping.py
   ```
2. Run the analysis notebooks for EDA and insights.

### Future Work
- Enhance the scraping to cover more regions and more detailed property data.
- Add machine learning models to predict future house prices based on the data.
